# Development Plan
---
Prompt for agents:
```
Below is a development plan for the Mimir AIP. The plan outlines the key tasks that must be completed(and in what order). You will be assigned a task to complete. This task will reference a plan file for that component(or a section of a plan file). First you must read the plan, see where this fits into the overall plan (@MimirAIPOverallPlan.md in Plan/), what the requerements are(what inputs ans ouptuts of this component are needed), then plan step by step how to complete this task. Then execute the plan, working in the small steps previously planned. After each step, check that there is no issues and that the output is correct. If there are any issues, fix them before moving on to the next step. Once the task is complete, report back with the results. Do NOT deviate from the plan, and do not skip any steps(DO NOT MOCK componets and then proceed as if they were in place, you must complete each component as outlined in the plan). If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please ask for clarification before proceeding.
