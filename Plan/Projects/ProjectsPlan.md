# Projects

Projects can be thought of as a 'workspace' for a specific use case, project will contain pipelines, ontologies, ML models and digital twins. Each project will have its own storage object which will be used to store all data for that project(ingested pipeline data, ml models, ontologies, digital twin data etc.).
