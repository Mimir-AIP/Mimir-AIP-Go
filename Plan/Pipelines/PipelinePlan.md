# Pipelines

Pipelines will be used for data ingestion, processing and output generation. There will be 3 types of pipeline; ingestion, processing and output(a pipeline can only be defined as one type). Each pipeline will be defined in a YAML format, specifying the steps. Throughout the life of a pipeline there will be a context window(max size to be determined [TODO]) which will store a list of objects(each step gets an object where data can be stored and accessed by ANY subsequent step in pipeline) context is dynamic so any output from a step will be stored in that step's context object. Steps can perform any action from either the builtin default plugin, OR a custom plugin installed by the user. The default plugin includes a variety of common functions such as; managing the context(CRUD operations on the entire context window or specific objects), making http requests, parsing json data, this will also include some basic conditional logic such as if/else statements, GOTO actions to allow for loops. Custom plugins will follow a standardised format.
