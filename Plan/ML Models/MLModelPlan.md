# ML Models

ML models will be created in a semi-automated way, once mimir has automatically generated the ontology for a project based on the ingested data, it will then use this ontology to determine what data is available and how it is structured, based on a set of deterministic rules it will then recommend a model type best suited to the data, user can view this recommendation and either accept it or choose a different model type. Once the model type is chosen, mimir will then use the data which has been ingested and stored, seperately for training and testing, then begin the training process. During training the user can view various metrics and visualisations to monitor the training process, once training is complete the model will be stored and can be used for inference within the digital twin or for other purposes. Similar to the ontology, mimir will continuously monitor the ml model results and if it detects a significant drop in performance it will alert the user and recommend retraining the model with new data. Additionally if the ontology is upadated(wither via the automated process after new data ingestion or via manual editing) mimir will also check if the changes to the ontology have any impact on the ml model performance, if it does it will alert the user and recommend retraining the model with the updated ontology and any new data that has been ingested and stored.
