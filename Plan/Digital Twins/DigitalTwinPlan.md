# Digital Twin

The digital twin will be a dynamic, ontology-backed representation of the project. It will be built using the ontology as a blueprint to determine what entities, attributes and relationships to include. The digital twin will not store a complete copy of all the data, rather it will reference the data stored in the storage object, and only store any changes or modifications to the data. The digital twin will be a location for performing analysis and predictive modelling of the data, it will reference the ML models for making predictions based on the data(not just the ingested data but through the digital twin you can 'alter' project data by creating hypothetical scenarios, e.g. what if I change this attribute of this entity to be higher/lower, how does that impact the predictions etc.). The digital twin will also be a location for querying the data using SPARQL queries. Withing the digital twin the user can setup actions(e.g. for the ingested data, if the ml model detects this value or a value above/below a certain threshold, trigger a export pipeline which could for example generate a report or send a push notification etc.).
